## Ranges are a very simple type of sequence that is most commonly used in for loops.
## we use range() constructor

for n in range(5):
    print(n)
## out put => 0,1,2,3,4
my_range = range(4)
print(my_range)
# => range(0, 4)

rage = range(7)
print(rage)
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)
